# Finger-Counting-with-Hand-Gestures

Here's the notebook, which contains the code to Detect hands and then detect Finger count and futrther it displays the sum of fingers from both hands.

I've used the concept of Motion detection to detect hands i.e. for 1st 30 frames, no hand should be present in the Region of Interest(ROI) neither the camera should be moved.
For finger counting I've used the concept of detecting defects in contour formed by hands.

I've also uploaded a screenshot of Output of this project
